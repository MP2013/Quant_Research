Energy Geolenz

This demo was created to map data without fusion tables. We succeeded in doing so by using XML and then mapping it using Google Maps. The end goal was to fetch the data from the database, convert to XML on the fly and then map it. Due to database issues we could not complete the database end and skipped straight to mapping the XML data.

Most work for this demo was completed by Harvinder Singh.
